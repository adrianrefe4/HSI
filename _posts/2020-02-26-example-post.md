## Introduction

Combining functional MRI with other modalities like EEG or MEG can reveal richer insights into brain dynamics—but processing and synchronizing large, heterogeneous datasets is tough. A cloud-native pipeline automates ingestion, preprocessing, and AI-driven mapping of multimodal signals.

## Cloud Infrastructure

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - Upload raw fMRI NIfTI files and EEG recordings to a secure object store (e.g., Google Cloud Storage).  
2. **Preprocessing Jobs**  
   - Trigger Cloud Run functions to run containerized workflows:  
     - fMRI: motion correction, normalization (FSL/AFNI)  
     - EEG: artifact removal, filtering (MNE-Python)  
3. **Orchestration**  
   - Use Cloud Composer (Airflow) to coordinate tasks, ensuring modalities are time-aligned.

## AI Mapping Workflow

- **Feature Extraction**  
  - Compute voxel-wise time series from fMRI and band-power features from EEG.  
- **Multimodal Fusion**  
  - Deploy a transformer-based model on Vertex AI to learn joint embeddings of fMRI+EEG signals.  
- **Brain Mapping**  
  - Generate activation maps per condition and modality, export as NIfTI heatmaps for visualization.

## Benefits

- **Scalability:**  
  Spin up hundreds of CPUs/GPUs for parallel preprocessing and model training.  
- **Reproducibility:**  
  Containerized steps ensure consistent results across runs.  
- **Collaboration:**  
  Share interactive NeuroGlancer links or JupyterLab notebooks via secure cloud endpoints.

## Considerations

- **Data Security:**  
  Encrypt files at rest/in transit, manage IAM roles to restrict access.  
- **Cost Management:**  
  Use preemptible instances for heavy compute steps and lifecycle rules to archive raw data.  
- **Latency:**  
  Batch and cache intermediate results to minimize repeated I/O.

## Conclusion

A cloud-based multimodal fMRI mapping pipeline unlocks deeper neuroimaging insights with automated, scalable, and secure workflows. Ready to streamline your next brain study? Let’s connect!
