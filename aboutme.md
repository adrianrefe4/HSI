title: About me
subtitle: A brief personal description
---

Hi, I'm Adrián Redondo Fernández, a Computer Science graduate from the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), currently pursuing a Master's in Health Data Science. My passion lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and neuroscience. I originally began my academic journey in psychology, but soon realized that I could delve deeper into understanding the human mind through mathematics and machine learning—prompting my transition into engineering.

My research interests focus on integrating humanistic and social science perspectives with computational approaches, especially in contexts that call for innovation, creativity, and unconventional problem-solving. I've developed projects involving convolutional neural networks and artificial intelligence, and I’m particularly drawn to computational neuroscience.

I envision a future where technological solutions are crafted with a nuanced understanding of human behavior—bridging scientific rigor with empathy and purpose.
