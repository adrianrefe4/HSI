Communication 1

We live in the era of information. Nowadays we have at our disposal significantly more means of communicating with one another than ever before in history. However, terms like polarization and echo chamber have grown in relevance. Why is it so difficult to communicate effectively? Can technology help us or is it hampering our capabilities to convey our true voice and connect deeply with each other? 

Language as an instrument

One could argue that being concerned about communication is not only worthless but also evil. In essence, we are communicating all the time either with the words that come out of our mouths — more or less elocuently — with non verbal language, even with our silence and what we are not doing. Attempting to harness our communication would be artificial and untrue. Becoming conscious about how we communicate unconsciously has been a long lasting historical effort to instrumentalize it for deceitful purpuses. Purer is a dog’s way of communicating which barks when he feels an urge for it, like a sneeze — an unhinged response that serves a straightforward motivation. Being aware complicates things. 

When we are able to substitue a word’s meaning at will, it’s easy for our cognitive threads to get entangled in our mental linguistic map. In this way, communication with our own self can be compromised irreparably.
